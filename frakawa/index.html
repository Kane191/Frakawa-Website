                <h3>My name is Francis K Waweru and I love Art.</h3>
                <p> I have grown to be a visual artist ever since  I can remember. I work hard 6 days a week to make  myself better in this field  that I love.</p>
                <p>I was born I Transnzoi county Kenya where I grew up with the same passion. At the age of 19 I relocated to Nairobi  where I joined Bobea Arts Centre school of fine arts. Here I studied hard due to my passion to learn and grow more in the world of art. I had the privilege to learn from Pascal Chuma ( one of the best visual artists in Kenya).</p>
                <p>My artworks reflects the inner me and I am inspired by different things in life, and they are; Love for colour, facial characters of different people, landscapes which are Godâ€™s creation and much more. I strive to push myself to the limit and learn something new in every painting that I do.</p>
